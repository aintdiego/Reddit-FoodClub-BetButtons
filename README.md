# Reddit-FoodClub-BetButtons
Maintains bet amount and places bet buttons (piggybacks off of diceroll123's stuff)

Should work with any browser with Tampermonkey ********NOW INCLUDING FIREFOX!********

**HOT TIPS!**

Because it is a form submission, I can't make it not switch you to the tab the button opens!
For a less annoying experience:
 - Open food club thread in it's own window
 - For each bet:
  - Click bet button
  - CTRL+SHIFT+TAB   go to tab to the left (aka the reddit tab)
 - The table on the "Current Bets" page will be highlighted in yellow when all 10 are placed
 - Now you can just X out the whole window

ALSO: Don't like how the bet amount button scrolls with you? Scroll down and read how to change it.
ALSO ALSO: There's nothing to stop you from submitting bets from past days. Try not to do this.
ALSO ALSO ALSO: There is no way to prevent Firefox from asking if you're really really sure you wanna place this bet every. single. time.

Enjoy!
